# ==================================================
# This file configures WiFi credentials for Raspberry Pi OS.
# Place this file in the boot partition of your SD card before first boot
# to enable headless WiFi setup.

#
# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this template to a new file (e.g., wpa_supplicant.conf)
# 2. Replace YOUR_COUNTRY_CODE with your ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code
#    (e.g., US, GB, DE, FR, CA, AU, JP, etc.)
# 3. Replace YOUR_SSID with your WiFi network name
# 4. Replace YOUR_PASSWORD with your WiFi password
# 5. Copy the configured file to the boot partition of your SD card
#
# For multiple WiFi networks, duplicate the network={} block for each network.

# Control interface for wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev

# Allow wpa_supplicant to update this configuration file
update_config=1

# Country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)
# This ensures WiFi operates on legal frequencies for your country
# Examples: US, GB, DE, FR, CA, AU, JP
country=YOUR_COUNTRY_CODE

# WiFi Network Configuration
network={
    # Network SSID (WiFi network name)
    ssid="YOUR_SSID"

    # Pre-shared key (WiFi password)
    # For WPA/WPA2 Personal networks
    psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"

    # Enable scanning for hidden networks
    # Set to 1 if your network doesn't broadcast its SSID
    scan_ssid=1

    # Priority (optional)
    # Higher numbers = higher priority when multiple networks are available
    # priority=1

    # Key management (optional, uncomment if needed)
    # key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  # For WPA/WPA2 Personal (most common)
    # key_mgmt=WPA-EAP  # For WPA/WPA2 Enterprise
    # key_mgmt=NONE     # For open networks (not recommended)
}

# Additional Network Example (commented out)
# network={
#     ssid="SecondaryNetwork"
#     psk="SecondaryPassword"
#     priority=2
# }

# For open WiFi networks without password (not recommended for security):
# network={
#     ssid="OpenNetworkName"
#     key_mgmt=NONE
# }

# For hidden networks, ensure scan_ssid=1 is set
